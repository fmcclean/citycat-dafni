# CityCAT on DAFNI

[![build](https://github.com/OpenCLIM/citycat-dafni/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenCLIM/citycat-dafni/actions)

This repo contains the files required to build and test the citycat-dafni model.
The binary executable for CityCAT is encrypted as this software is not publicly available.
[`Wine`](https://www.winehq.org/) is used to run the executable as it was built for Windows but is required to run on Linux.
All processing steps are contained in [`run.py`](https://github.com/OpenCLIM/citycat-dafni/blob/master/run.py).
