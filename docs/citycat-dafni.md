## CityCAT on DAFNI

CityCAT (City Catchment Analysis Tool) is a unique software tool for modelling, analysis and visualisation of surface water flooding. CityCAT enables rapid assessment of combined pluvial and fluvial flood risk and allows assessment of the effects of different flood alleviation measures. This DAFNI model generates input data for CityCAT, runs a simulation and then converts the output data. The effects of buildings, green areas and inflow boundary conditions can be included. Results are provided in a range of formats and a metadata JSON file is created which can be used to create DAFNI datasets.

| RAINFALL_MODE       | Rainfall mode               | If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period" then the rainfall depth corresponding to the `DURATION` and `RETURN_PERIOD` are extracted from the relevant CSV file in the `future-drainage` dataslot. If the `TIME_HORIZON` is anything other than "baseline", the rainfall depth is then uplifted by the percentage given in the CSV file. If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "total_depth" then the `TOTAL_DEPTH` parameter is used to define the amount of rainfall and the `RETURN_PERIOD` and `TIME_HORIZON` parameters are ignored. The rainfall depth value, either directly provided or extracted from FUTURE-DRAINAGE, is used to generate a storm profile in combination with the summer profile and `DURATION` parameter. |
| TOTAL_DEPTH         | Total depth (mm)            | The total depth of rainfall during the event. This parameter is only used if `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "total_depth".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| DURATION            | Duration (hours)            | The duration of the rainfall event. This value is used in combination with the rainfall depth and summer profile to generate a storm profile. If `RAINFALL_MODE` is "return_period", this value is also used to extract a rainfall depth from FUTURE-DRAINAGE. Only specific values are available as there is a limited number of durations within FUTURE-DRAINAGE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| PROJECTION          | Projection                  | Input the numerical code for the required projection (e.g. 27700). Use a projection that uses meters not decimal degrees. If left blank the model will apply the appropriate Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinate System.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| OPEN_BOUNDARIES     | Open Boundaries             | If `OPEN_BOUNDARIES` is "True", water will be allowed to leave the domain at the edges. If it is "False", water will bounce back from the edges of the domain and cannot leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| PERMEABLE_AREAS     | Permeable areas             | If `PERMEABLE_AREAS` is set to "polygons", polygons from the `green_areas` dataslot are used to define areas which are permeable. Otherwise, all cells are treated as being "permeable" or "impermeable", depending on the selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ROOF_STORAGE        | Roof storage                | Depth of water that can be stored on rooftops (m). This value is uniformly applied to all buildings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| POST_EVENT_DURATION | Post-event Duration (hours) | The duration of the dry period following the rainfall event. After the rainfall event ends, CityCAT will continue to run for this period of time. This is to allow water to continue propogating and accumulating on the floodplain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| OUTPUT_INTERVAL     | Output Interval (seconds)   | Time between depth and velocity outputs (s). Decreasing this value will lead to a higher number of output files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| SIZE                | Domain Size (km)            | The width and height of the domain to create, centered at the location specified by `X` and `Y`. This value is only used if no data is available in the `boundary` dataslot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| X                   | Domain Centroid X (OSGB)    | The X coordinate of the domain centroid in OSGB. This value is only used if no data is available in the `boundary` dataslot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Y                   | Domain Centroid Y (OSGB)    | The Y coordinate of the domain centroid in OSGB. This value is only used if no data is available in the `boundary` dataslot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| RETURN_PERIOD       | Return Period (years)       | The return period of the rainfall event. This parameter is only used if `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period". If this is provided, then data must be present in the `future-drainage` dataslot. This return period is used to extract a rainfall depth from the FUTURE-DRAINAGE dataset and select the percentage uplift if required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| DISCHARGE           | Discharge (m3/s)            | Value of discharge boundary condition, if provided then the `flow_polygons` dataslot is required. Discharge is distributed uniformly over the `DURATION` and gets multiplied by the number of cell boundaries intersected by the polygons in the `flow_polygons` dataslot. Therefore, it is normally advisable to divide the total desired discharge by the number of overlapping cell boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
